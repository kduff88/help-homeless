                    HELPING HERTS HOMELESS is a charity run by volunteers, focused on addressing the problems of local homelessness.
                    It was formed [as North Herts Sanctuary] 25 years ago when a small group of church people recognised the need to address the growing problem of local homelessness . Originally operating as a Winter Night Shelter, it now operates on a 24/7 basis, with extensive day services.
                    HHH owns and supports the hostel in Nightingale Rd, Hitchin which offers accommodation for up to 17 individuals each night. The current service provider is Stevenage Haven who operates the hostel.
